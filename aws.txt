AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that enables frontend web and mobile developers to quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS. Amplify provides two services: Amplify Hosting and Amplify Studio. Amplify Hosting provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment. 

Amplify Hosting features:
1. Amplify Hosting supports the common SPA frameworks, for example, React, Angular, Vue.js, Ionic, and Ember, as well as static site generators like Gatsby, Eleventy, Hugo, VuePress, and Jekyll.
2. Manage production and staging environments for your frontend and backend by connecting new branches
		Amplify Hosting is designed to work with feature branch and GitFlow workflows. Amplify leverages Git branches to create new deployments every time a developer connects a new branch in their repository. After connecting your first branch, you can create a new feature branch deployment by adding a branch as follows:

			On the branch list page, choose Connect branch.
			Choose a branch from your repository.
			Save and then deploy your app.
